## Description

This site was made to develop our ability to cooperate in a group setting and combine all the learning we've done up to this point into one full stack project. It is a forums style website made for fans of the Archer tv show to post and discuss various topics sorted by season. It consists of several different pages created using express-handlebars. Users are able to register for an account, log in, and begin posting/replying and creating their own bio and display names. All data is stored in a mysql database and is accessed using sequelize.
